## General info
This is the beginnings to an issue tracker program that I'd like to use myself in the future. There are a few design issues that I intend to
address in the near future (04/03/2021) that include the coloring, navbar functionality, and the structure.
Here is a brief synopsis of the functionality: 

* User logs in using their username and password. ![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483445-0c134b00-9469-11eb-9ed6-41b7873e6474.png)

* From the Home PageUser can navigate to the Dashboard, view current bugs, or create new bugs. ![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483471-2c430a00-9469-11eb-83b3-7f8c3a8cc18c.png)
* In the Dashboard the user can take a look at the number of bugs there are and their level of severity. ![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483487-4ed52300-9469-11eb-829a-570f37791618.png)
* Under View Bugs, the user can see what current bugs need attention. ![view_bugs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483692-5ea13700-946a-11eb-9883-b0a49019e099.png)
* If they click on a bug, they can see a dashboard of information concerning the bug in question. ![bug-tracker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483621-05d19e80-946a-11eb-8d6b-e812775716ba.png)
* The user can then make edits to said bug. ![edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483600-eaff2a00-9469-11eb-9c98-710e1d280f64.png)
* Under Create Bug, the admin will be able to create a new bug and assign it to a member of their team. ![create](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69326962/113483559-a83d5200-9469-11eb-99e7-99414bbf8192.png)

	
## Technologies
The front end of this was created with REACT version 17.0.1

## Live Version

The live version of this front end project is currently hosted on github pages.

## Uses and Future Expansion

As mentioned above, this application is intended to be used by myself in the future... so there are a lot of changes that I would like to make.
The first one is to do a facelift on the design elements of this. This application was designed to look similar to the help desk system that my 
last retail company used, but with a little flair from the University I went to. Now... it just feels like an outdated design.

The next step would be to create the server of this and a connectivity to a database. As of right now I have the intentions of using MongoDB, 
but I may change it up and use PostgreSQL. 

If I were to expand this application, here are a few elements I would add:

* Method to save images that were submitted to a database
* Change the format from just picture to video submissions (maybe making the the video a live feed)

## Open Source

If you would like to contribute to the design of this project, create a fork and have at it! I am open to suggestions. 
This is an application that is supposed to foster collaboration, I'd be remiss if I didn't open it's creation to collaboration.
